title:  BellyDynamic - Implement a Deep-Learning based Graph Embedding module
description: BellyDynamic is itself, a data structure that can be used to store dynamic graph objects. In the current version, temporal graphs can only be represented by timestamps as edge attributes. Analyzing temporal behavior may require trajectory representations of nodes that capture both structural and attribute properties of graphs in an evolving graph space. Here, the task is to explore non-linear models (e.g. deep learning) to effectively represent nodes in a vector space for studying evolution of networks. This module would facilitate an effective learning process (e.g., node classification, link prediction, graph reconstruction) for many real-world problems including label propagation, information diffusion, community influence etc. that can be applied on top of many heterogeneous networks.
