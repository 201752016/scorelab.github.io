title:  Drola - Drone with Lora - Backend with Realtime Database
description: Drones use their radio link to communicate with their ground stations and controllers. Those radio links can communicate for a limited range. When a drone fly automatically through way points it may go away from radio link. Then ground station unable to monitor that drone any more. We want a system to monitor automatically flying drones using long range communication network “LORA” . Its mandatory to uniquely identifying each drone, for that we want to bind unique key to each drone. The final product should be a separate unit which can externally mound on any kind of drone. Currently we have a system consisting with seperate devices to mount on drones and web system to monitor their locations. That device send data like location, timestamp, and nodeid with AES encryption. This is an one way communication system which sends messages only from drones to the DroLa web System. For further developments we are seeking to improve the system as follows. We want a new platform to send messages in more general way instead of current fixed message format. Then we can introduce this system to other tracking solutions also. We want to design a bidirectional communication protocol and implement it including message passers for both Lora Node side and web server side. Current system is running on web sockets, drone locations are collected by Lora receivers and send them to the web server through a web socket server. we want to move to a realtime database instead of using websockets. If you willing to join with us as a GSOC student please send your proposal with a design for the system. Your new ideas also warmly welcome.
