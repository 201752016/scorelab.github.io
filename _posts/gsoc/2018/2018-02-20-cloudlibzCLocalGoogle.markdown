description: Emulation engine for Google Cloud. <br/>Google cloud provide multiple of emulators. However it does not emulate the entire cloud. In this project you are required to identify key components which does not have any emulators, and implment them. Since there are number of services, it is up to you to do the initial research and identify which components you can implement during the GSoC period. NodeJS is the prefered language for this and you will spend time with mentors implementing the specifications of Google cloud provider.
expectedresults: <ul style="list-style:inherit"><li>CLI tool which will emulate number of Google Cloud Services</li><li>Maintain good code quality throughout</li><li>Write proper unit tests</li><li>Integrate the build and test cases to TravisCI</li></ul>
