title: Nodecloud - Rackspace Provider support
description: Rackspace Provider is another key provider which we are missing at the moment. Student has a bigger task to do here as Rackspace does not offer their own NodeJS SDK. What they offer is pkgcloud binding for Rackspace. Student will have to implement the NodeSDK using REST API and will have to use the developed SDK to support Rackspace provider for Nodecloud.
expectedresults: Support for VM, Container, DNS, Storage, CDN has to be implemented
